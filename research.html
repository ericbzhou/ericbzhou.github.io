            <h1>RESEARCH STATEMENT</h1>
            <p>
                <span class="emphasis red">My academic objectives are driven by a fundamental question: how are human and artificial intelligence (AI) co-evolving?</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                I am drawn to questions about <span class="emphasis red">how generative AI can facilitate human augmentation by empowering individuals and their intellectual capabilities, rather than driving automation that diminishes human agency.</span> I focus on creativity – a faculty that is a uniquely human form of intelligence and expression - because it underpins innovation, problem-solving, and self-expression. My passion for understanding how human creativity and markets for artists are responding to the introduction of generative technologies was fostered through discussions with several of my closest friends who work in creative fields.
            </p>
            <p>
                My research agenda primarily centers around two interrelated themes:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Societal consequences of generative AI</li>
                <li>Human creativity and creative markets in response to AI</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
               I am also secondarily interested in:
            <ul>
                <li>Multi-agent systems to simulate social processes</li>
                <li>Design and analysis of human-AI interfaces in healthcare</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                I apply a combination of <span class="emphasis red">deep learning, Large Language Models, multimodal feature extraction, and causal inference methods</span> to large-scale datasets to derive insights from unstructured data, specializing in working with image data.
            </p>

                        abstract:"Recent artificial intelligence (AI) tools have demonstrated the ability to produce outputs traditionally considered creative. One such system is text-to-image generative AI (e.g., Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, DALL-E), which automates humans' artistic execution to generate digital artworks. Utilizing a dataset of over 4 million artworks from more than 50,000 unique users, our research shows that over time, text-to-image AI significantly enhances human creative productivity by 25\% and increases the value as measured by the likelihood of receiving a favorite per view by 50\%. While peak artwork content novelty, defined as focal subject matter and relations, increases over time, average content novelty declines, suggesting an expanding but inefficient idea space. Additionally, there is a consistent reduction in both peak and average visual novelty, captured by pixel-level stylistic elements. Importantly, AI-assisted artists who can successfully explore more novel ideas, regardless of their overall novelty prior to AI assistance, may produce artworks that their peers evaluate more favorably. Lastly, AI adoption decreased value capture (favorites earned) concentration among adopters. The results suggest that ideation and filtering are likely necessary skills in the text-to-image process, thus giving rise to \"generative synesthesia\" - the harmonious blending of human exploration and AI exploitation to discover new creative workflows.",

                        abstract:"Artists are rapidly integrating generative text-to-image models into their workflows, yet how this human–AI collaboration affects creative discovery remains unclear. Leveraging large-scale data from an online art platform, we compare AI-assisted creators to matched non-adopters to assess novel idea contributions. Initially, generative AI increases novelty among a concentrated subset of artists, driven primarily by substantial productivity gains; however, marginal novelty per artifact declines post‑adoption, reflecting a shift toward high‑volume, incremental exploration, ultimately yielding a greater aggregate of novel artifacts by AI adopters. We observe no evidence of a human–AI complementarity effect beyond productivity-driven gains. Notably, the release of open-source Stable Diffusion accelerates novel contributions across a broader, more diverse group, suggesting that text‑to‑image tools facilitate exploration at scale, initially enabling persistent breakthroughs by a select “mastermind” group, driven by substantial volume increases, and subsequently enabling widespread novel contributions from an emergent “hivemind” of artists.",

                        abstract:"In online marketplaces, sellers can rely on alternative mechanisms to signal their quality when they lack rich transaction histories. Using scraped data on GPU sales from eBay, we find that certain image signals can substitute for reputation to increase conversion rates amongst sellers with less than 100% positive reputation, and conditional on making a sale, can realize a 5% price premium on average. However, the effects are only significant for less reputable sellers.",
