            <h1>RESEARCH STATEMENT</h1>
                <p>
                    <span class="emphasis red">My academic objectives are driven by a fundamental question: how are human and artificial intelligence (AI) co-evolving?</span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    I study <span class="emphasis red">how generative AI can augment human capabilities, focusing on creativity</span> - a uniquely human form of intelligence that underpins important economic activities like innovation and analytical problem-solving. For the human experience, it embodies expression and self-actualization. My interest in this area was sparked through conversations with friends working in creative fields.
                </p>
                    My primary research themes are:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Societal consequences of generative AI</li>
                    <li>Human creativity and creative markets in response to AI</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    My research will further extend to:
                <ul>
                    <li>Data governance & AI policy</li>
                    <li>Design and analysis of human-AI collaborative systems</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    I combine theoretical and philosophical perspectives on human creativity with <span class="emphasis red">causal inference and advanced empirical tools, such as Deep Learning, Large Language Models (LLMs), and multimodal feature extraction</span>, to examine the impacts of AI on human creativity and creative markets.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I hold a <span class="emphasis red">Bachelor's degree from Washington University in St. Louis (2018)</span>, a <span class="emphasis red">Master's of Business Administration from Carnegie Mellon Tepper School of Business (2021)</span>, and a <span class="emphasis red">Master's of Science in Business Administration from Washington University in St. Louis (2023)</span>.
                    Prior to my PhD studies, I worked as a marketing consultant for a large market research firm and as a Machine Learning contractor for a non-profit organization.
                </p>

                        abstract:"Artists are rapidly integrating generative text-to-image models into their workflows, yet how this human–AI collaboration affects creative discovery remains unclear. Leveraging large-scale data from an online art platform, we compare AI-assisted creators to matched non-adopters to assess novel idea contributions. Initially, generative AI increases novelty among a concentrated subset of artists, driven primarily by substantial productivity gains; however, marginal novelty per artifact declines post‑adoption, reflecting a shift toward high‑volume, incremental exploration, ultimately yielding a greater aggregate of novel artifacts by AI adopters. We observe no evidence of a human–AI complementarity effect beyond productivity-driven gains. Notably, the release of open-source Stable Diffusion accelerates novel contributions across a broader, more diverse group, suggesting that text‑to‑image tools facilitate exploration at scale, initially enabling persistent breakthroughs by a select “mastermind” group, driven by substantial volume increases, and subsequently enabling widespread novel contributions from an emergent “hivemind” of artists.",

One such system is text-to-image generative AI (e.g., Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, DALL-E), which automates humans' artistic execution to generate digital artworks. Utilizing a dataset of over 4 million artworks from more than 50,000 unique users, our research shows that over time, text-to-image AI significantly enhances human creative productivity by 25\% and increases the value as measured by the likelihood of receiving a favorite per view by 50\%. While peak artwork content novelty, defined as focal subject matter and relations, increases over time, average content novelty declines, suggesting an expanding but inefficient idea space. Additionally, there is a consistent reduction in both peak and average visual novelty, captured by pixel-level stylistic elements. Importantly, AI-assisted artists who can successfully explore more novel ideas, regardless of their overall novelty prior to AI assistance, may produce artworks that their peers evaluate more favorably. Lastly, AI adoption decreased value capture (favorites earned) concentration among adopters. The results suggest that ideation and filtering are likely necessary skills in the text-to-image process, thus giving rise to \"generative synesthesia\" - the harmonious blending of human exploration and AI exploitation to discover new creative workflows.",

                        abstract:"The emergence of generative artificial intelligence (AI) has sparked debate about its impacts on creative markets, echoing concerns raised following the advent of Adobe Photoshop, which incited fears of labor displacement. However, those earlier innovations spurred new artistic genres and, ultimately, market expansion. We examine how digital creators adapt to AI tools and to data-training opt-out mechanisms, and how these choices reshape competition in creative markets. Using data from one of the largest industry art platforms, we find that the market share of AI-assisted creators and artifacts is increasing as creators sensitive to AI competition, i.e., who opt out of data training, withdraw from the platform. To understand how creators strategically adapt their assortment of artifacts in response to AI disruption, we introduce and employ Visual-Concept Modeling, a multimodal feature extraction approach that enables scalable characterization of prototypical artifacts based on visual and conceptual elements. We identify an increase in the concentration of character concept art, driven by artists' rising usage of generative AI tools. At the same time, we find that AI-sensitive creators, particularly freelancers, have begun to strategically reduce production in character art without substituting for other artifact types. Collectively, these findings suggest the unrestricted allowance of AI and use of creators' work for AI training absent consent or compensation may discourage creators from participating in the market. We emphasize the need for revised data protection policies, such as strengthened copyright enforcement and opt-in datasets, to foster equitable participation and long-term sustainability in creative markets.",

Using scraped data on GPU sales from eBay, we find that certain image signals can substitute for reputation to increase conversion rates amongst sellers with less than 100% positive reputation, and conditional on making a sale, can realize a 5% price premium on average. However, the effects are only significant for less reputable sellers.",
