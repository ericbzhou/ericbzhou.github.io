            <h1>PHILOSOPHY</h1>
            <p>"How are human and artificial intelligence (AI) co-evolving?"</p>
            <p>
                Recognizing the transformative impacts and inherent risks of AI, I formulate my research agenda and teaching philosophy around equipping society to leverage AI responsibly and revealing its potential to augment human capabilities while accounting for its unintended consequences.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the classroom, this translates to a commitment to fostering an inclusive and hands-on learning environment that empowers students to harness AI as a tool for enhancing their intellectual capabilities and learning efficiency. I prioritize practical applications of AI in business contexts, from fostering a deeper technical understanding of generative technologies to highlight capabilities and limitations of such tools, to emphasizing ethical considerations and real-world implications. I aim to cultivate critical thinking and adaptability among students, preparing them to navigate the evolving landscape of business technology with confidence and responsibility. My teaching philosophy is effectively captured by the student testimonials below.

                        `<b>Having you as a professor made a huge difference.</b> Hearing you critique and give your own contemporary take on the course design really validated a lot of how I was feeling. You were honest about how certain aspects could be better, and that transparency helped me stay motivated. <b>You brought real insight to the material, and because of that I ended up enjoying IS more than I probably would have in another section. Your openness made the class feel more human, and I think it helped a lot of us feel less intimidated by the content and jargon. Thank you again for everything this semester, and for giving us this space to share our background.</b>`,
                        `<b>I just want to say thank you. I came into this class hearing all the horror stories about IS being tough or boring, but your approach made it really engaging. You made the content relevant, and your emphasis on AI definitely encouraged me to use it as a learning tool instead of fearing it.</b> Thanks again for such a great semester—I really appreciated how much you cared about making the course both manageable and meaningful.`,
                        `<b>I want to thank you, Eric. Thank you for making this class much more bearable and being someone that I think a lot of us can relate to.</b> There aren’t many opportunities where the person teaching us is someone not that much older than us. <b>You understand us better than one of these other lecturers would. Additionally, thank you for introducing us to more interesting content with your AI explanations.</b> It’s something that is practical and useful for us, undoubtedly. Like I said, there’s a lot wrong with this class, but you’ve done us a favor by helping us along the way!`,
                        `<b>You’re one of the best teachers I’ve had at this school.</b> There are a lot of teachers that are disconnected from the content and just read from the slides. I understood you had to do that at times but <b>you were able to connect the slides with real world situations or things you've worked on.</b> That gives the class more meaning because it shows it could have value if you are pursuing this career. <b>You emphasized what you believed to be of importance to us outside of the classroom, and that is more helpful than teaching just to regurgitate the information for the test.</b> I enjoyed the semester, so thank you.`,
                        `While teaching to the class is important, real-world applications, such as going beyond course content with AI and emerging tech discussions, helped me have a different understanding when test time came around. <b>I am glad that I was able to take your course specifically, as you had a very energetic and passionate approach, as an individual who is just entering a growing industry. Other professors do not have the same direct hands-on experience with what is going on in the biztech world, as they have been ‘out of the game,’ as one could say, for a while now. Thank you for your continued interest in the class and the course content (the stuff that actually matters in the business world), as it does indeed show through in your lectures.</b>`,
                        `<b>The one thing from this course that I found useful to my academic career was the content surrounding AI, more specifically, the permission and guidance to use it as a tool to support and leverage my learning.</b> As AI is just beginning to emerge in the academic landscape, in the past, I’ve felt shameful or lazy for using it. However, <b>I appreciate how Eric gave us permission and encouraged us to use it as a tool to work smarter and learn more efficiently, and even showed us how to get the most out of its use.</b>`,
                        `<b>Your tangents on AI have actually led me to do some of my own research into how AI is transforming the insurance industry.</b> This has been very intriguing for me as it led me to discover the future of insurance... <b>So, if there’s one thing that I am thankful for learning about in this course, it is the topic of AI because it sparked my interest in how I can use it in what I plan to do and stay knowledgeable on industry trends. I really appreciate you making the class as enjoyable as possible.</b>`,
                        `<b>I appreciated the discussions revolving around AI and current news in that field. I think that these lessons were super helpful in my understanding of how AI is transforming the business world, which ultimately impacts my future career.</b> I am extremely grateful for the opportunity to be in this section. <b>You’ve made an impact in my learning and allowed me to gain valuable knowledge despite the questionable design of this course.</b> I truly believe that I can carry this knowledge with me throughout my professional career.`,
                        `<b>Honestly I had pretty low expectations for this class, especially given all of the horror stories I have heard throughout the past few years so I just wanted to say thank you for making this class the opposite of that</b> and I will certainly be in a better position in the future given what we have learned throughout this semester.`,
                        `I would sincerely like to thank Eric for teaching this course. <b>He is a genuinely kind, patient, and supportive professor. Even though I had little background in IS before taking this class, Eric made the material accessible, interesting, and understandable.</b> I am very grateful for his effort and guidance throughout the semester.`,
                        `<b>I want you to know that I truly believe you’re going to be an incredible professor.</b> Before taking your course, I didn’t have a clear understanding of what Information Systems was. But your teaching has inspired me to pursue business technology. <b>You created a learning environment that removed the pressure of tests defining our worth or knowledge, and that made all the difference for me because I wasn’t just studying for a grade, but rather because I wanted to learn and absorb everything IS had to offer.</b>`,
                        `<b>Honestly, you’ve been one of the chillest and most effective professors I’ve had at BU, and I’m genuinely grateful for the way you teach and how approachable you are.</b> Thanks again for everything!`,
                        `I would sincerely like to stay in touch as <b>you have been a great professor and this class has been tremendously helpful. I hope you know you are doing a great job and the students love this class.</b>`,
                        `I think that the side comments and advice that you gave to the class was extremely helpful and useful as I move forward. In fact, I believe that this was the most important part of the course as a whole. <b>The advice and guidance you gave us has [given me much positive towards my career]. For my final notes - Thank you for making this class as painless as you possibly can. I really appreciate your time and effort that you gave to us.</b>`,
                        `I enjoyed the way you taught this class and at the beginning of the semester heavily stressed the importance of our mental health. <b>I am super happy I took this class with you and wish you the best in your future teaching careers!</b>`,
                        `This course even made me consider an IS concentration, especially since employers are actively seeking tech-savvy candidates. Overall, I genuinely looked forward to coming to this class—not because the content was always exciting, but because it felt practical and gave me a sense of growth after each lecture. <b>The low-pressure environment also made it easier to stay engaged, and for that, I just want to say thank you.</b>`,
