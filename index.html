            <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
                <p>
                    I am a fifth-year <span class="emphasis red">PhD candidate in Information Systems at Boston University Questrom School of Business (expected 2026)</span> and am affiliated with the Digital Business Institute at Questrom.
                    I am advised by Professor <a href="https://www.leedokyun.com/" target="_blank">Dokyun Lee</a> and am a member of the <a href="https://www.leedokyun.com/bitlab.html" target="_blank">BIT Lab</a>. 
                </p>
                <p><span class='emphasis red'>I am on the 2025-2026 job market.</span></p>
                <p>
                    <span class="emphasis red">My academic objectives are driven by a fundamental question: how are human and artificial intelligence (AI) co-evolving?</span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    I study <span class="emphasis red">how generative AI can augment human capabilities, focusing on creativity</span> - a uniquely human form of intelligence and expression that underpins innovation, problem-solving, and self-expression. My interest in this area was sparked through conversations with friends working in creative fields.
                </p>
                    My primary research themes are:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Societal consequences of generative AI</li>
                    <li>Human creativity and creative markets in response to AI</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Secondary interests include:
                <ul>
                    <li>Multi-agent systems to simulate social processes</li>
                    <li>Design and analysis of human-AI collaborative systems</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    I combine theoretical and philosophical perspectives on human creativity with <span class="emphasis red">causal inference and advanced empirical tools, such as Deep Learning, Large Language Models (LLMs), and multimodal feature extraction</span>, to examine the impacts of AI on human creativity and creative markets.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I hold a <span class="emphasis red">Bachelor's degree from Washington University in St. Louis (2018)</span>, a <span class="emphasis red">Master's of Business Administration from Carnegie Mellon Tepper School of Business (2021)</span>, and a <span class="emphasis red">Master's of Science in Business Administration from Washington University in St. Louis (2023)</span>.
                    Prior to my PhD studies, I worked as a marketing consultant for a large market research firm and as a Machine Learning contractor for a non-profit organization.
