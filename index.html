            <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
                <p>
                    I am a fifth-year <span class="emphasis red">PhD candidate in Information Systems at Boston University Questrom School of Business (expected 2026)</span> and am also affiliated with the Digital Business Institute at Questrom.
                    I am advised by Professor <a href="https://www.leedokyun.com/" target="_blank">Dokyun Lee</a> and am a member of the <a href="https://www.leedokyun.com/bitlab.html" target="_blank">BIT Lab</a>. 
                </p>
                <p><span class='emphasis red'>I am on the AY25-26 academic job market.</span></p>
                <p>
                    <span class="emphasis red">My academic objectives are driven by a fundamental question: how are human and artificial intelligence (AI) co-evolving?</span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am drawn to questions about <span class="emphasis red">how generative AI can facilitate human augmentation by empowering individuals and their intellectual capabilities, rather than driving automation that diminishes human agency.</span> I focus on creativity â€“ a faculty that is a uniquely human form of intelligence and expression - because it underpins innovation, problem-solving, and self-expression. My interest in understanding how human creativity and markets for artists are responding to the introduction of generative technologies was fostered through discussions with several of my closest friends who work in creative fields.
                </p>
                    My research agenda primarily centers around two interrelated themes:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Societal consequences of generative AI</li>
                    <li>Human creativity and creative markets in response to AI</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                I am secondarily interested in:
                <ul>
                    <li>Multi-agent systems to simulate social processes</li>
                    <li>Design and analysis of human-AI collaborative systems</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    I combine <span class="emphasis red">theoretical and philosophical perspectives on human creativity</span> with <span class="emphasis red">causal inference</span> and cutting-edge empirical tools like <span class="emphasis red">Deep Learning, Large Language Models (LLMs), and multimodal feature extraction</span> to understand the impacts of AI on human creativity and creative markets. My research reaches far beyond just a management audience; it synthesizes perspectives from philosophy, psychology, and AI to shed light on one of the most pressing issues today: <span class="emphasis red">how generative AI will impact the most 'human' aspects of society.</span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    I hold a <span class="emphasis red">Bachelor degree from Washington University in St. Louis (2018)</span>, a <span class="emphasis red">Master of Business Administration from Carnegie Mellon Tepper School of Business (2021)</span>, and a <span class="emphasis red">Master of Science in Business Administration from Washington University in St. Louis (2023)</span>.
                    Prior to my PhD studies, I worked as a marketing consultant for a large market research firm and as a Machine Learning contractor for a non-profit organization.
