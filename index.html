            <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
                <p>
                    I am a fourth-year <span class="emphasis red">PhD candidate in Information Systems at Boston University Questrom School of Business (expected 2026)</span> and am also affiliated with the Digital Business Institute at Questrom.
                    I am advised by Professor <a href="https://www.leedokyun.com/" target="_blank">Dokyun Lee</a> and am a member of the <a href="https://www.leedokyun.com/bitlab.html" target="_blank">BIT LAB</a>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    My research interests are broadly in the <span class="emphasis red">application, innovation and impact</span> of AI and frontier technologies on creativity and in the future of work.
                    In particular, I am interested in:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The interface between human creativity and generative AI</li>
                    <li>Human adaptation to technology</li>
                    <li>Competition in creative domains in response to technology shocks</li>
                    <li>Human-AI collaboration</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    I apply a combination of <span class="emphasis red">deep learning, multimodal feature extraction, and causal inference methods</span> to large-scale datasets to derive insights from unstructured data.
                </p>
                    I hold a <span class="emphasis red">Bachelor degree from Washington University in St. Louis (2018)</span>, a <span class="emphasis red">Master of Business Administration from Carnegie Mellon Tepper School of Business (2021)</span>, and a <span class="emphasis red">Master of Science in Business Administration from Washington University in St. Louis (2023)</span>.
                    Prior to my PhD studies, I worked as a marketing consultant for a large market research firm and as a Machine Learning contractor for a non-profit organization.
                </p>
